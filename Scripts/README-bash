Explanation of the Bash Script:
Define Directories: FASTA_DIR and OUTPUT_DIR are variables that store the paths to the directories containing the FASTA files and the output, respectively.
Create Output Directory: The script ensures the output directory exists by creating it if it doesn't.
Load Modules: The script includes comments for loading necessary modules using the module load command. Uncomment and modify these lines as needed based on your HPC environment.
Activate Virtual Environment: If you're using a Python virtual environment, the script includes commented lines for activating and deactivating it. Uncomment and modify these lines as necessary.
Run Python Script: The script calls the Python script with the FASTA directory and output directory as arguments.
Echo Statement: At the end, an echo statement indicates that the job submission script has finished running.
